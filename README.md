# 🦾 EMG-Controlled Prosthetic Hand

## 📘 Project Overview
A **low-cost, research-oriented prosthetic hand** that utilizes **EMG signals acquired from OYMotion sensors** to control **motor-driven finger movements through an Arduino-based control system**.  
This project was developed as part of a **charity initiative funded by HASWA (Health andSocial Welfare Association)**, aimed at providing **affordable, functional prosthetic solutions** for individuals with upper-limb disabilities in Pakistan.
